# CoffeelikeCN (WIP)
This repository is dedicated to replicating the signature drinks and brewing techniques of popular Chinese coffee brands like Luckin, Cotti and Manner. Each brand has its own directory containing detailed recipes and preparation methods. 

Work in progress, feel free to contribute if you can!

TODO:
- [] List all available drinks for each brand
- [] Gather recipes from various sources
- [] Test and refine recipes

# Important Note
This repository is for educational and personal use only. All recipes and brand names are the property of their respective owners. Please do not use this content for commercial purposes.

All the recipes are sourced from publicly available information, with majority of them being imitated based on taste tests and user contributions. If you have any concerns regarding the content or advice to improve, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Despite having listed the closest ingredient you could find in Internet in this repo, you might not be able to cut down the cost of buying a Â¥9.9 coffee by making it at home. This repository is best-suited for those who are living in remote area or not in China. I would sincerely recommend you support the original brands by purchasing their products if you are able to do so, and enjoy the convenience when the low price still lasts.
